## Last Meeting Action Items



* **Action item 1**: (Mehul) -[ opensearch-project/.github#184](https://github.com/opensearch-project/.github/pull/184) - Mehul working through the comments
* **Action item 2** (Sam / Eli) (How do we define roadmaps? Suggestion is submit a proposal for inclusion in the .github MAINTAINERS file/process) 
    * Sam has drafted[ opensearch-project/.github#192](https://github.com/opensearch-project/.github/pull/192)
    * Overall feedback is how do we make this lighter and less ‘mandatory’ feeling. There are too many overarching pieces to this. Design, requirements, process, template, all in one. Sam will simplify it to an essential ‘best practices’ doc.
    * Sam will incorporate final feedback and have it completed this week \

* **Action item 5** (Eli / Kris) Leadership Committee responsibilities: Add context on how LC has the ability to step in to raise awareness on duplicate work. May include remediation.
