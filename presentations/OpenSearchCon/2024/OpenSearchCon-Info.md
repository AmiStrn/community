## Overview

What is OpenSearchCon?

OpenSearchCon is the annual conference that brings the OpenSearch community together to learn, connect, and collaborate. In 2024, we expanded OpenSearchCon beyond North America with the addition of events in Europe and India. OpenSearchCon aims to educate and inspire with presented sessions, participant-driven meetings, and exhibits and demonstrations from OpenSearch Project partners. Users, administrators, and developers come to OpenSearchCon to explore solutions to real-world problems, network with their peers, and take a look into the future of search, observability, and security applications.

## Presentations

Some speakers have chosen to share their presentation slides with the community. 

We also offer the community OpenSearchCon templates to use for their talks if they feel this would be helpful.
